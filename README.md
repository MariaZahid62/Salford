# ðŸ“° Salford â€“ A Digital Magazine

**Salford** is a digital magazine crafted entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, designed to capture the visual elegance of print publications within a fully functional browser experience. It's responsive, multi-page, and deliberately coded without the use of any CMS or frameworks.

Built from the ground up, Salford avoids drag-and-drop templates in favour of custom layouts, modular styling, and a refined structure. Each page is manually coded, giving full creative control over flow, design, and interactivity, resulting in a lightweight and seamless scrollable experience.

The first issue centres around modern **interior design** with articles exploring compact living through thoughtful layouts and the emotional impact of colour palettes that soothe rather than stimulate. The content focuses not only on aesthetics but also on how design choices affect mood, mindset, and movement within space.

From maximal function in minimal square footage to layered hues that calm, each section is styled like a magazine spread yet coded to respond, adapt, and breathe in a digital environment. This issue sets the tone for whatâ€™s to come, with more pages and themes currently under development.
